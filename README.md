# Storypark Assessment
This is the repo that I will use to complete the Storypark technical assessment.

### Task 2:  
What's the most interesting technical article you've read recently? 
What did you like about it and why should we take a look at it?  
Earlier in the year I was taking a paper called "Safety Critical Systems" in which we covered 
software bugs that cause loss or life or money. When I was doing my own research into software 
failures I came across the Boeing 737 Max and the MCAS software bug that caused 2 planes to crash.  
It was a tragedy and it shows us that companies are willing to rush out products without proper 
testing to keep up with the their competitors, which is a dangerous road.

### Task 3:  
I created a function to do what is requested. It can be found in the ArrayFlattener file. 

It is not a stand alone program so it doesn't run a main method, however I did write some 
unit tests so you can be sure that it works as requested.  

You can run these with the command from the root directory:  
`python3 ArrayFlattener/FlattenTests.py`  


### Task 4:  
This program was completed with a main method and is to be run using CLI:  
`python3 DisplayStaff/DisplayStaff.py`  

I used the url from github to get the JSON data.  
There are some small rounding errors with the latitude/longitude maths (shown by the unit test) 
but I feel that it is accurate enough.
